# Frozen Icon (Me) 
Adds a visual freeze indicator next to your HP bar when frozen or entangled.

This plugin detects when your player is affected by freezing or binding spells (e.g., Ice Barrage, Entangle) and displays an icon beside the HP bar indicating the duration of the effect. Useful for PvP and PvM awareness.
